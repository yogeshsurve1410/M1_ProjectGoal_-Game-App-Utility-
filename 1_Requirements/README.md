# CALCULATOR APP


INTRODUCTION :
==============

* Calculator is one of daily useful thing. Here in this project,We can use lots of calculations,conversion,and lots of activities.
* In simple calculator user are able to calculate operations like addition,substraction,division,power or take root.
* In Scientific Calculator user are able to calculate operations like power,ncr,npr,logarithimic calculations as well as trignometric and inverse trignometric.

The switch-case statement is used to write a simple calculator program in C language. The remainder operator % is normally used with data values. To print the remainder operator %% is used in the first printf() function. The variable ch store the operator, similarly the variables num1, and num2 stores the two numbers. The switch has condition “ch” so the entered operator is matched with which case label those case label statements are executed, and display result to the screen. If the entered operator is not matched with the case labels then the default statement will be executed and it will display the message “Error! Invalid Operator.” to the screen

=============
Who:
======
The project can be used almost by all people.At the end,user satisfaction is the goal of the project.

What:
======
 add,subtract,multiply,divide,trignomentric functions,inverse trignomentric functions,power,factoiral,mod,sqaure root,cuberoot Functions,logrithmic functions
 can be done by this Application.

When:
======
The project can be used when to calculate many operatios related to basic arthimetic,logarthimic,.

Where:
=====
The Calculator is essential for all purpose and for all schools, colleges, private libraries, and other organizations. They can use this software as the purpose of calculations.

How:
======
It is a takes input from the system. Here UML diagrams are used to supplement the working of this application. The system thus made should be reliable, durable and above all should have least possible maintenance costs.
