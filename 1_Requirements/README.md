By convention, the day is the smallest calendrical unit of time; the   measurement of fractions of a day is classified as timekeeping. The generality of this definition is due to the diversity of methods that have been used in creating calendars.
* Years are classified as normal years of 365 days and leap years of 366 days. Leap years occur in years that are evenly divisible by 4.Years that are divisible by 100 (century     years such as 1900 or 2000) cannot be leap years unless they are also divisible by 400.
* The 365 days are divided into 12 months i.e. January, February, March, April, May, June, July, August, September, October, November, and December.
