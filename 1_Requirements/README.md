# CALCULATOR APP


INTRODUCTION :
==============

* Calculator is one of daily useful thing. Here in this project,We can use lots of calculations,conversion,and lots of activities.
* In simple calculator user are able to calculate operations like addition,substraction,division,power or take root.
* In Scientific Calculator user are able to calculate operations like power,ncr,npr,logarithimic calculations as well as trignometric and inverse trignometric.

SWOT Analysis :
=============

STRENGTHS
===========
The ultimate strength of Calculator is its innovative,more work ability,user-friendly and long lasting etc..

WEAKNESSES
===========
proper inputs are be given to the functions.

OPPORTUNITIES
==============
The tech-based market has a huge opportunities in capturing the youth market. And this calculator comparatively already one step ahead than other

THREATS
============
The slower growth in technological innovation will also bring a significant threat in the upcoming dynamic world.












4W's and 1'H
=============
Who:
======
The project can be used almost by all people.At the end,user satisfaction is the goal of the project.

What:
======
 add,subtract,multiply,divide,trignomentric functions,inverse trignomentric functions,power,factoiral,mod,sqaure root,cuberoot Functions,logrithmic functions
 can be done by this Application.

When:
======
The project can be used when to calculate many operatios related to basic arthimetic,logarthimic,.

Where:
=====
The Calendar is essential for all purpose and for all schools, colleges, private libraries, and other organizations. They can use this software as the purpose of adding notes, view dates,day,months

How:
======
It is a takes input from the system. Here UML diagrams are used to supplement the working of this application. The system thus made should be reliable, durable and above all should have least possible maintenance costs.
